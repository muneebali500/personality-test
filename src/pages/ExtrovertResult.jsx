            Extroverts are interested in and concerned with the external world.
            They gain energy from socializing and being "out and about."
            Extroverts actually feel restless when they spend too much time
            alone (or in silence); they're at their best when they can engage
            outwardly. When given the chance, an extrovert will talk with
            someone else rather than sit alone and think. In fact, extroverts
            tend to think as they speak, sort of "thinking out loud," (whereas
            introverts like to think first and speak later). As an extrovert,
            ideas likely become more "real" to you when you can discuss them
            with others. You may have a faster pace and cadence to your voice.,
            and you may be inclined to jump into new activities and try them out
            rather than researching them and deciding in advance what to do.
            This can be both a strength (taking initiative) and a weakness
            (rushing into things without thinking them through). Keep in mind
            that there is no such thing as a pure extrovert (or introvert), and
            most people fall somewhere in the middle of the
            extroversion/introversion continuum. You may even act like an
            extrovert in one circumstance and an introvert in another. That's
            normal! And, even if you just "lean" extroverted, it's a powerful
            thing to know about yourself â€” because it means knowing which
            activities energize you and which ones drain you.
