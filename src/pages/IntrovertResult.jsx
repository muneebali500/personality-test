            Introverts are a diverse group of people who prefer to look at life
            from the inside out. They gain energy through inner reflection and
            solitude, and they get more excited by ideas than by external
            activities. As an introvert, you're likely to prefer deep, close
            relationships to superficial ones. You may enjoy socializing — an
            "outgoing introvert" — but feel drained afterward. When introverts
            have conversations, they listen well and expect others to do the
            same; this tendency toward focused attention is part of what makes
            social time draining for you. Other introverts habits you may relate
            to include thinking first and talking later; avoiding phone calls;
            preferring solo work to team work; and enjoying writing. Writing
            appeals to introverts because they can express themselves without
            intrusion — and they can have time to find just the right word. Even
            the brains of introverts are different from those of extroverts.
            Introverts are sensitive to the brain chemical dopamine, which means
            they may feel frazzled in overstimulating or new environments. Keep
            in mind that there is no such thing as a pure introvert (or
            extrovert)! Most people fall somewhere in the middle of the
            introversion/extroversion continuum, and you may act like an
            extrovert in one circumstance and an introvert in another. Even if
            you just "lean" introverted, it can be incredibly useful to know
            where you get your energy and what drains you.
